IIS Setup:
1.  Web Server Install - install .NET Core hosting bundle - "dotnet-hosting-6.0.9-win.exe" - verified v6.0.9.
2.  Create New Web Site - WebSearch.   Ensure that you have a unique Application pool name for WebSearch.
3.  Create Directory, and put 2 SS3 libraries -> SecuSearchAPI.dl and SecuSearchAPI.NET.dll into that directory.  Take the directory made, and ensure that is in the Windows path of searchable locations.
4.  Set gpedit.msc - "Lock Pages in Memory" - settings for group IIS_USERS
5.  Create Windows directory for SS3 librarires: secusearchapi.dll & SecuSearchAPI.Net.dll.  Make sure to add to Windows "Path"

Common Errors and how to solve:
1.  Save Empty FPDB_FAILURE - "SECUSEARCHAPI_DLL_UNLOADED" means that the web site was not able to find the SecuSearch libraries.
2.  *** NO INIT, means that the SS3 has failed.   Usually means, that the SS3 "Lock Pages in Memory" setting needs to be configured per user.  Add User Group -> IIS-IUSRS to the Local Group Policy Editor.  Local Computer Policy -> Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Local Policies -> User Rights Assignment -> Lock pages in memory.   Reboot computer.
